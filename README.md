# Sentiment Analysis with SageMaker
 

### Project

[Sentiment Analysis Web App](https://github.com/ian0549/Sentiment-Analysis-with-SageMaker/tree/master/website/index.html) is created  from a notebook and collection of Python files to be completed. The result is a deployed RNN performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews complete with publicly accessible API and a simple web page which interacts with the deployed endpoint. This project assumes that you have some familiarity with SageMaker.

## Setup Instructions

The notebooks provided in this repository are intended to be executed using Amazon's SageMaker platform. The following is a brief set of instructions on setting up a managed notebook instance using SageMaker, from which the notebooks can be completed and run.

### Log in to the AWS console and create a notebook instance

Log in to the AWS console and go to the SageMaker dashboard. Click on 'Create notebook instance'. The notebook name can be anything and using ml.t2.medium is a good idea as it is covered under the free tier. For the role, creating a new role works fine. Using the default options is also okay. Important to note that you need the notebook instance to have access to S3 resources, which it does by default. In particular, any S3 bucket or objectt with sagemaker in the name is available to the notebook.

### Use git to clone the repository into the notebook instance

Once the instance has been started and is accessible, click on 'open' to get the Jupyter notebook main page. We will begin by cloning the SageMaker Deployment github repository into the notebook instance. Note that we want to make sure to clone this into the appropriate directory so that the data will be preserved between sessions.

Click on the 'new' dropdown menu and select 'terminal'. By default, the working directory of the terminal instance is the home directory, however, the Jupyter notebook hub's root directory is under 'SageMaker'. Enter the appropriate directory and clone the repository as follows.

```bash
cd SageMaker
git clone https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment.git
exit
```

After you have finished, close the terminal window.

### Open and run the notebook of your choice

Now that the repository has been cloned into the notebook instance you may navigate to any of the notebooks that you wish to complete or execute and work with them. Any additional instructions are contained in their respective notebooks.



## Deployment

So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.

The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.

In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.

Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.

### Setting up a Lambda function

The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.

#### Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function

Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.

Using the AWS Console, navigate to the **IAM** page and click on **Roles**. Then, click on **Create role**. Make sure that the **AWS service** is the type of trusted entity selected and choose **Lambda** as the service that will use this role, then click **Next: Permissions**.

In the search box type `sagemaker` and select the check box next to the **AmazonSageMakerFullAccess** policy. Then, click on **Next: Review**.

Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example `LambdaSageMakerRole`. Then, click on **Create role**.

#### Part B: Create a Lambda function

Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.

Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on **Create a function**. When you get to the next page, make sure that **Author from scratch** is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example `sentiment_analysis_func`. Make sure that the **Python 3.6** runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on **Create Function**.

On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below. 

```python
# We need to use the low-level library to interact with SageMaker since the SageMaker API
# is not available natively through Lambda.
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # The SageMaker runtime is what allows us to invoke the endpoint that we've created.
    runtime = boto3.Session().client('sagemaker-runtime')

    # Now we use the SageMaker runtime to invoke our endpoint, sending the review we were given
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = '**ENDPOINT NAME HERE**',    # The name of the endpoint we created
                                       ContentType = 'text/plain',                 # The data format that is expected
                                       Body = event['body'])                       # The actual review

    # The response is an HTTP response whose body contains the result of our inference
    result = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

    return {
        'statusCode' : 200,
        'headers' : { 'Content-Type' : 'text/plain', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' : '*' },
        'body' : result
    }
```

Once you have copy and pasted the code above into the Lambda code editor, replace the `**ENDPOINT NAME HERE**` portion with the name of the endpoint that we deployed earlier. You can determine the name of the endpoint using the code cell below.



###Setting up API Gateway
Now that our Lambda function is set up, it is time to create a new API using API Gateway that will trigger the Lambda function we have just created.

Using AWS Console, navigate to Amazon API Gateway and then click on Get started.

On the next page, make sure that New API is selected and give the new api a name, for example, sentiment_analysis_api. Then, click on Create API.

Now we have created an API, however it doesn't currently do anything. What we want it to do is to trigger the Lambda function that we created earlier.

Select the Actions dropdown menu and click Create Method. A new blank method will be created, select its dropdown menu and select POST, then click on the check mark beside it.

For the integration point, make sure that Lambda Function is selected and click on the Use Lambda Proxy integration. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.

Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the Lambda Function text entry box and then click on Save. Click on OK in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.

The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the Actions dropdown and click on Deploy API. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example prod.

You have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model. Make sure to copy or write down the URL provided to invoke your newly created public API as this will be needed in the next step. This URL can be found at the top of the page, highlighted in blue next to the text Invoke URL.
